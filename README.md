## Features  

### 1. **Multi-Level Referral System (Direct & Indirect Referrals)**  
- The system supports a **multi-level referral structure**, meaning users can gain both **direct and indirect** referrals.  
- **Direct Referral**: A new user who signs up using a user’s referral link is counted as a **direct referral**.  
- **Indirect Referral**: If a direct referral shares their referral link and a new user registers, that new user is counted as an **indirect referral** for the original referrer.  
- This hierarchical referral system ensures that users benefit from their growing network, encouraging engagement.  
- The referral count is automatically updated as new users join using referral links. 

### 2. **1-Click Copyable Referral Link**  
- Users have a referral link that can be shared with others for inviting new users.  
- The referral link is **click-to-copy**, meaning users don’t need to manually select and copy the URL.  
- A simple click on the "Copy" button automatically copies the referral link to the clipboard.  
- This improves usability and enhances user experience.

### 3. **Forgot Password (User & Admin Login)**  
- Users and Admins can reset their passwords if they forget them.  
- The "Forgot Password" option on the login page allows users to request a password reset.  
- Upon request, an email is sent containing a secure link to reset the password.  
- Users can click the link, which redirects them to the password reset page on our website.  
- After entering a new password, they can successfully regain access to their account.   

### 4. **User Dashboard - Referral Tracking**  
- Each user has a **dashboard** displaying their total number of referrals, including:  
  - **Direct referrals** (users who registered directly through their referral link).  
  - **Indirect referrals** (users who registered through their direct referrals).  
- This helps users track their network growth and potential earnings (if applicable).  

### 5. **Admin Panel - Multi-Level Registrations Table**  
- The admin panel provides a **detailed overview** of all users and their **referral hierarchy**.  
- A structured table displays:  
  - Each user's **direct and indirect referrals**.  
  - The number of users they referred at each level.  
  - A breakdown of the **multi-level registration network**.  
- This feature helps admins **manage and monitor** the referral network efficiently.
